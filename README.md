# chat

A new Flutter project.

A flutter application in which authentication can be done by email-password. 

Home Page/ Dashboard contains link to both the solutions i.e. Part1 and Part2. It also contains the logout button. 

Part1 shows if notification is seen or not. If notification is not seen then it is shown by blue color else by white color. You can click on the notification to see it. Notification is handled through Firebase Realtime Database. 

Part2 has the chat feature. You can create group by clicking on the floating button and can add members in the group by searching their Email Id. Lastly, you need to write the group name and the group is created. Chat is handled through Firestore. 

Now you can start the chatting in the group.
